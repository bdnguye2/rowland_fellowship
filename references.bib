                  active component of a marine extract from Pleurobranchus
                  forskalii found during a high-throughput screening campaign
                  to characterize new protein synthesis inhibitors. It was

                  cells, as well as in vivo against mammalian cells. Our

                  ribosomes on mRNA. These data provide a rationale for the

          important role in drug discovery, in the past few years
          most Big Pharma companies have either terminated or
          considerably scaled down their natural product operations.
          This is despite a significant number of natural
          product-derived drugs being ranked in the top 35 worldwide
          selling ethical drugs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. There were
          15 new natural product-derived drugs launched from 2000 to
          2003, as well as 15 natural product-derived compounds in
          Phase III clinical trials or registration at the end of
      2003. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in
      natural product research due to the failure of alternative
      drug discovery methods to deliver many lead compounds in
      key therapeutic areas such as immunosuppression,
      anti-infectives, and metabolic diseases. To continue to be
      competitive with other drug discovery methods, natural
      product research needs to continually improve the speed of
      the screening, isolation, and structure elucidation
      processes, as well addressing the suitability of screens
      for natural product extracts and dealing with issues
      involved with large-scale compound supply.},

          ancient times and in folklore for the treatment of many

          methodologies enabled a vast array of bioactive secondary
          metabolites from terrestrial and marine sources to be

          become current drug candidates. This brief review aims to
          highlight historically significant bioactive marine and

          dereplication techniques to rapidly facilitate their
          discovery. Furthermore a discussion of how natural product
          chemistry has resulted in the identification of many drug
          candidates; the application of advanced hyphenated
          spectroscopic techniques to aid in their discovery, the
          future of natural product chemistry and finally adopting
          metabolomic profiling and dereplication approaches for the
